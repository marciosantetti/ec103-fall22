# The big picture

It is clear that something has happened after the 1800s to produce such an increase in GDP *per capita*.

--

<br>

And with this, a few .hi-orange[remarkable] facts:


  * Increasing *living standards*;
  * Rapid *technological progress*;
  * Higher degree/pace of *social mobility*;
  * *Globalization.*

# What has led us here?


This can be boiled down to the advent of .hi[capitalism].

  * We all know what the term *capitalism* means, but we will qualify this term better for our purposes.
  
--

<br>

And .hi-orange[what] purpose is that?

--

  * To think in .hi[economic] terms.
  
--

<br>

> Studying economics is studying how *society provides for its material well-being*.

# What has led us here?

In doing so, to better understand how the macroeconomy operates, we must understand *capitalism* as a .hi[social system].

--

As such, it has particular

  * historical origins;
  * unprecedented features and institutions.
