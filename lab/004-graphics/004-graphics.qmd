# The `ggplot2` package


## The `ggplot2` package

<br>

The `ggplot2` package is an R package developed by [Hadley Wickham](https://hadley.nz/), based on the "grammar of graphics."

## The `ggplot2` package

<br>


One of the most appealing aspects of `ggplot2` is that is maps (*tidy*) *data* to **aesthetics**.

<br>

. . .

It works by adding **layers** to an initial blank "canvas."

<br>

. . .

Instead of working with pre-made graphics (as in Excel), we are able to build custom plots by adding incremental pieces of information.


## The `ggplot2` package

<br>


The main pieces of information that go into a *ggplot* are:

<br>

  1. Your variables (the *aesthetics*);

  2. The selected *geometries* (`geom_`);

  3. Subsequent formatting options (scales, themes, titles, subtitles, etc.)
  


## The `ggplot2` package

<br>

The `ggplot2` package is part of the tidyverse (no need to install anything new).

Let us make sense of these first concepts by working with the `gapminder` package.
