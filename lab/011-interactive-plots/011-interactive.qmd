# Interactivity

## Interactivity

<br>

So far, we have been dealing with so-called *static* plots.

<br>

. . .

But many times, it would be better to present our data in a more *dynamic* and *interactive* way.

<br>

. . .

We thus can complement our {ggplot} knowledge with the [{plotly}](https://plotly.com/r/) R package.

## Interactivity

<br><br>

The basic idea is that we can transform any *static* ggplot into an *interactive* chart by using the *ggplotly()* function on top of our existing plotting code.

Before we head over to RStudio, here are some useful resources:
