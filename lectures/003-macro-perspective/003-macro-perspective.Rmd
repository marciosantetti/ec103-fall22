# Last time

<br>

After a brief overview of what defines the .hi[capitalist] social system, we will focus on how this system works as a .hi-orange[whole].

--

In case one is interested in the economic functioning of the entire system, it requires studying .hi[Macroeconomics].

--

  - Macroeconomics focuses on the .hi-orange[determinants] of total *national* output (i.e., its *goods* and *services*).


--

<br>

Thus we .hi[do not] focus on *household* income, but *national* income; not individual prices, but the *whole economy's* price level, and so on.

# The size of the economy

Economists use .hi-orange[aggregate statistics] to describe macroeconomic phenomena.

  - Here, *aggregate* simply means .hi[sum].


--

<br>

Among these, the .hi[Gross Domestic Product] (GDP) is the leading measure of a country's overall economic *performance* and *size.*

--

  * It is the sum (in money value) of all .hi-orange[final] goods and services produced in an economy in a given year. As described by the economist Diane Coyle:


> .small[*"Everything from nails to toothbrushes, tractors, shoes, haircuts, management consultancy, street cleaning, yoga teaching, plates, bandages, books, and the millions of other services and products in the economy."*]


---

# The size of the economy


Notice that GDP only accounts for .hi[final goods and services].

  - *What does this mean?*
  
--

Many goods are produced by one firm and further used in production as an .hi-orange[input] by another firm.

--

Also, the same idea can be applied to .hi[used goods].

--

<br>

This is done to avoid .hi[double counting].


--

<br>

This [`short document by the BEA`](https://www.bea.gov/system/files/2019-10/Classroom-Stu-Intermediate%20Inputs.Final_.pdf) may help you in getting a better idea on final/intermediate goods.

# Key macroeconomic problems

Macroeconomic problems and concerns are diverse, but may be summmarized by .hi[three] major issues:

  1. .hi[Output growth];
  
  2. .hi[Unemployment];
  
  3. .hi[Inflation].
  
--

<br>

Every economic policy maker will state that their goals are .hi[high output growth], .hi-orange[low unemployment], and .hi[low inflation] (or stable prices).

--

<br>

.right[...But are these *feasible* altogether?]

# Key macroeconomic problems


On average, economies tend to .hi[rise] over time.

--

However, this process has its short-run  *ups* and *downs*..smallest[.footnote[Picture taken from Case, Fair, and Oster (2012).]]

* These periods of *ups* and *downs* experienced by a national economy are known as .hi[business cycles.]

* The highest point of the business cycle is known as the .hi-orange[peak].

* The lowest, the .hi[trough].

* An economic .hi-orange[expansion] is the period from a *trough* to a *peak*.

* And from *peak* to *trough* we have economic .hi[recessions].

* Most business cycles are not .hi-orange[symmetrical].

# Key macroeconomic problems

<br><br><br>

Over the long-run trajectory of economic growth, business cycles produce different .hi[unemployment] and .hi-orange[inflationary] contexts.

All of these issues will be further investigated in the *following weeks*.

# The components of the macroeconomy

<br><br>

From an aggregate perspective, the .hi[participants] of an economy can be grouped in 4:

  1. *Households*;
  2. *Firms*;
  3. The *government*;
  4. The *rest of the world*.
  
--

<br>

Households and firms form the .hi-orange[private sector], while the government is the .hi[public sector], and the rest of the world is the .hi-orange[foreign sector].

# The components of the macroeconomy

<br><br>

If we analyze GDP from the perspective of .hi[spending], it can be broken down into the following components:

<br>

* .hi[*Consumption*] of goods and services;

* Private .hi[*investment*];

* .hi[*Government*] expenditures;

* .hi[*Net exports*] (*Exports* - *Imports*).


---

# The components of the macroeconomy

<br>

.hi[Consumption] accounts for all household consumption expenditures on final goods and services.

  - Household appliances, haircuts, concert tickets, groceries,...

--


<br>

It usually accounts for about 2/3 of total GDP.

--

<br>

[`US aggregate consumption data`](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCE)

---

# The components of the macroeconomy

<br>

Aggregate .hi[investment] accounts for businesses purchasing new machinery, new software, new plants, as well as household residential investment.

  - It also includes changes in *inventories*, which is unsold output produced in the reference year.
  

--

<br>

[`US aggregate private investment data`](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GPDI)


---

# The components of the macroeconomy

<br>

.hi[Government] expenditures account for federal, state, and local instances consumption and investment decisions.

  - Building highways, new schools, military spending, health & education,...

  - Unemployment and veteran benefits, social security payments are .hi[not] included. These are transfers that will likely be spent on *consumption.*

# The components of the macroeconomy

<br>

.hi[Net exports] is the difference between .hi-orange[exports]&mdash;domestically produced goods that a country sells abroad&mdash;and .hi-orange[imports]&mdash;goods and services produced in other countries that residents of another country purchase. 


  * We call the gap between exports and imports the .hi[trade balance]. If a countryâ€™s exports are larger than its imports, then a country has a .hi-orange[trade surplus]; if imports exceed exports, we have a .hi[trade deficit].

# The components of the macroeconomy

We can now write down the GDP measurement as:

<br>

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{GDP} \ = \text{Consumption + Investment + Government Spending + Net exports}
\end{aligned}
$$

<br>

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{GDP} = C + I + G + (X - M)
\end{aligned}
$$
