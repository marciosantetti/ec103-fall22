  # Real vs. nominal GDP
  
  Simply looking at *nominal* values when evaluating economic statistics may be misleading.

--
  
  Consider the number of cars sold, for instance.

--
  
  * Does an SUV have the *same* prce today, relative to 1985?
  
  --
  
  <br>
  
  
  
  Thus, to have a more *accurate* basis for evaluating economic growth, economists prefer .hi[real] measures, as they account for inflation.

--
  
  For the case of GDP, we use the .hi-orange[GDP deflator] to .hi[*normalize*] nominal GDP values.

  # Real vs. nominal GDP
  
  [put table 6.5]


calculate real gdp from it.

$$
  \begin{aligned}
\text{Real GDP} = \dfrac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{GDP Deflator}}
\end{aligned}
$$

# Same measure, different countries

# Same measure, different countries

How do we know if an economy is doing well?

--

One way to go about it is to compare itsv economic perfomance with previous years.

--

However, comparing economic performance .hi[among different countries] is a powerful tool for economists, especially in periods of expansions and recessions.

--

Recall the concept of .hi-orange[Nominal] GDP.

  * Given that we do not have a uniform currency around the globe, how do we compare the .hi[*same*] statistic (GDP) for countries with .hi[*different*] currencies (e.g., dollar, euro, yen, peso, etc.)?
  
--

Using an .hi[exchange rate]&mdash;the value of one currency in terms of *another* currency, is a way to compare the same economic measure across different countries.


---

# Same measure, different countries

One of the main common denominators for comparing different countries are .hi[purchasing power parity] (PPP) equivalent exchange rates. 

--

Suppose country *A*'s GDP in 2020 was $2.0 trillion, while country *B*'s was $5 trilion.

--

Country *A*'s currency is called *z*, while country *B*'s currency is *y*.

--

How much is country *A*'s GDP *in terms of* country *B*'s currency?

--

Given that 1.70 *z* = 1 *y*, we have



$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{A's GDP in y units} = \dfrac{\text{A's Nominal GDP}}{\text{Exchange rate (z/y)}}
\end{aligned}
$$

--

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{A's GDP in y units} = \dfrac{2.0}{1.70} = 1.176 \ \text{trillion}
\end{aligned}
$$

  # Same measure, different countries
  
  What about countries with different .hi[population sizes]?
  
  
  --
  
  The simplest way to evaluate a country's GDP taking into account its population size is to compute teh GDP *per capita*.

<br>

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{GDP per capita} = \dfrac{\text{GDP}}{\text{Population size}}
\end{aligned}
$$

# GDP vs. well-being

<br>

Do you believe that a country's GDP *accurately* measures how well its population is?

  [now more conditions to evaluate whether gdp implies higher living standards -- had this discussion in the first week.]

  # GDP vs. well-being
  
  
  Moral of the story: no measure is perfect. we have to be critical about it and evaluate them alongside other measures, according to our interests.
