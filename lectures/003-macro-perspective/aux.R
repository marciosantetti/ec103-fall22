  # The size of the economy
  
  One caution when computing GDP is to avoid .hi[double counting].

--
  
  Counting output more than once is a statistical .hi-orange[mistake], and may overstate the size of an economy.

  For instance, suppose a farmer sells oats to a miller by $50. The miller, then, refines it and produces oat flour. A bakery's owner purchases this oat flour by $100. This bakery sells oat cakes adding up to $200 per week.

# Real vs. nominal GDP

A .hi[crucial] distinction in Economics is between .hi-orange[real] and .hi-orange[nominal] values.

--

For the case of GDP, this is especially important when .hi[inflation] is such an important component of the economy.

--

> .hi-orange[Inflation] is a *sustained* increase in sn economy's price level.

--
  
  <br>
  
  The .hi[nominal] value of any economic measure means implies a statistic in terms of .hi-orange[actual prices] that exist at the time.

--
  
  On the other hand, .hi[real] values refer to the *same* statistic after it has been .hi-orange[adjusted for inflation].


---
  
  # Real vs. nominal GDP
  
  Simply looking at *nominal* values when evaluating economic statistics may be misleading.

--
  
  Consider the number of cars sold, for instance.

--
  
  * Does an SUV have the *same* prce today, relative to 1985?
  
  --
  
  <br>
  
  
  
  Thus, to have a more *accurate* basis for evaluating economic growth, economists prefer .hi[real] measures, as they account for inflation.

--
  
  For the case of GDP, we use the .hi-orange[GDP deflator] to .hi[*normalize*] nominal GDP values.

--
  
  
  > The .hi[GDP deflator] is a price index measuring the average prices of all final goods and services included in the economy.

  # Real vs. nominal GDP
  
  [put table 6.5]

$$
  \begin{aligned}
\text{Real GDP} = \dfrac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{GDP Deflator}}

# Same measure, different countries

How do we know if an economy is doing well?

--

One way to go about it is to compare itsv economic perfomance with previous years.

--

However, comparing economic performance .hi[among different countries] is a powerful tool for economists, especially in periods of expansions and recessions.

--

Recall the concept of .hi-orange[Nominal] GDP.

  * Given that we do not have a uniform currency around the globe, how do we compare the .hi[*same*] statistic (GDP) for countries with .hi[*different*] currencies (e.g., dollar, euro, yen, peso, etc.)?
  
--

Using an .hi[exchange rate]&mdash;the value of one currency in terms of *another* currency, is a way to compare the same economic measure across different countries.


---

# Same measure, different countries

One of the main common denominators for comparing different countries are .hi[purchasing power parity] (PPP) equivalent exchange rates. 

--

Suppose country *A*'s GDP in 2020 was $2.0 trillion, while country *B*'s was $5 trilion.

--

Country *A*'s currency is called *z*, while country *B*'s currency is *y*.

--

How much is country *A*'s GDP *in terms of* country *B*'s currency?

--

Given that 1.70 *z* = 1 *y*, we have



$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{A's GDP in y units} = \dfrac{\text{A's Nominal GDP}}{\text{Exchange rate (z/y)}}
\end{aligned}
$$

--

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{A's GDP in y units} = \dfrac{2.0}{1.70} = 1.176 \ \text{trillion}
\end{aligned}
$$

  # Same measure, different countries
  
  What about countries with different .hi[population sizes]?
  
  
  --
  
  The simplest way to evaluate a country's GDP taking into account its population size is to compute teh GDP *per capita*.

<br>

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{GDP per capita} = \dfrac{\text{GDP}}{\text{Population size}}
\end{aligned}
$$

  Moral of the story: no measure is perfect. we have to be critical about it and evaluate them alongside other measures, according to our interests.
