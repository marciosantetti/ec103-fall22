# Last time

<br>

Last time, we looked at some official US .hi[data] on unemployment, as well as some basic .hi-orange[definitions].

--


<br><br>

Now it is time to investigate some of the most relevant .hi[relationships] that unemployment shares with other .hi-orange[macroeconomic] variables.

--

<br><br>

Lastly, we will also study some of the main .hi[explanations for] unemployment, since it may come from different phenomena.

# Unemployment and other aggregates


When output grows *quickly*, unemployment tends to .hi[fall].

--

When output grows *more slowly* or *falls*, unemployment tends to .hi[rise].

--

  - Why would this happen?
  
  - .smaller[Lower unemployment &rarr; higher wages &rarr; increased workers' bargaining power &rarr; better income distribution.]

This association is known as .hi-orange[Okun's law].

---

# Unemployment and other aggregates

<br>

In more detail, Okun's law claims that there is a stable relationship between the .hi[change in the unemployment rate] $(\Delta u)$ and .hi-orange[real GDP growth] $(g_y)$.

<br>

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta u = a + b \times (g_y)
\end{aligned}
$$

<br>

where $b$ is called the .hi[Okun coefficient], and $a$ is the change in unemployment when the economy does not grow in a given period (i.e., $g_y = 0$).

# Unemployment and other aggregates

Based on these data, the *Okun coefficient* (*b*) equals -0.4, and *a*, 1.33. 

--

  * What does this mean?

--

<br>

And what if one wants to keep unemployment constant (meaning $\Delta u = 0$)? How much would the economy have to grow?

---

# Unemployment and other aggregates

It would take this amount of real GDP growth just to keep unemployment constant $(\Delta u = 0)$ for two main reasons:

  * .hi[Population] (and, consequently, the labor force) is still growing;
  
  * .hi[Labor productivity] is rising over time (implying that output per worker grows faster than employment).
  
--

In other words, each year there are more individuals *looking for jobs* (due to population growth), while technology keeps improving, so that *less people* are needed to produce the same amount of output over time (productivity growth).

--

Therefore, GDP has to grow to keep the change in unemployment .hi[steady] over time.

---



# Unemployment and other aggregates

How does unemployment relate with the .hi[price level]?

--

In other words, when *less* people are unemployed, does this affect .hi-orange[inflation]?

# Explaining unemployment

# Explaining unemployment

<br>

The reasons for high unemployment are .hi[manifold].

--

<br>

Some of the main .hi-orange[causes] of unemployment may be classified by:

  * .hi[Demand];
  
  * .hi[Structural];
  
  * .hi[Frictional] factors.



---

# Explaining unemployment


Some people may be unemployed because .hi[not enough] goods or services that *require* their labor are being currently produced.

--

  * Thus there is a .hi[lack of demand] for these workers.


--

When the available jobs in the economy are .hi[not matched] by the current candidates (i.e., there is a a *mismatch* between jobs and workers), unemployed is classified as .hi-orange[structural].

--

  * As potential reasons, there may be a lack of the necessary skills for the job, or perhaps the necessary workers are located in different parts of the country.
  
--

Throughout a person's worklife, they may be *transitioning* between jobs, moving to a new area, entering the job market after graduating, etc.

--

  * This kind of unemployment is considered .hi[frictional], comprehending just a "looking" period.

---

# Explaining unemployment

<br>

Different .hi-orange[causes], different .hi[solutions].

--

Depending on what we believe the cause of current unemployment is, we may work with different .hi[policies/solutions].

--


<br><br>

.right[
What are some .hi-orange[procedures] for each cause of unemployment?
]

---

# Explaining unemployment


Whether unemployment is demand-driven or structural, it is a matter of policy discussion.

--

However, looking at the available .hi[data] always helps.

--

<br>

The .hi[Beveridge curve] is a relationship that puts together the number of .hi-orange[unemployed] workers and the number of .hi-orange[job vacancies]. 

--

  * In a scenario with *low* vacancies but *high* unemployment, the latter is probably due to the .hi[lack of demand].

--

  * Conversely, with *low* unemployment and a *high* number of job vacancies, unemployment will likely be .hi[structural].
