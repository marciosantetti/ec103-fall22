# A trade-off

When thinking about *policy priorities*, economists (and the general population) usually .hi-orange[agree] on the following:

  * .hi[Low employment] and .hi[low inflation] are desirable.
  
--

  * However, the .hi-orange[bitter truth] is that, usually, when unemployment is *low*, inflation tends to *rise.*
  
  * And when unemployment is *high*, inflation tends to *fall.*

--

Therefore, experiencing a sustainable scenario with both variables at low rates is almost impossible.

--

<br>

Then, we face a .hi[trade-off]:

  * How to balance people's jobs and the price level?


---

# A trade-off

This issue is of special importance during .hi[election] times.

--

How the economy is going&mdash;and this has a lot to do with *unemployment* and *inflation*&mdash;may define (re-)election results.

  * This resonates directly with the general public, who directly feels the effect of both variables in their .hi-orange[daily lives].
  
--

<br>

That said, how to find the .hi[balance] between unemployment and inflation levels?

--

<br>

The usual belief within economic poiicy is that .hi-orange[a little bit of inflation] *does not hurt*.

  * As long as it remains .hi[stable]!

# Inflation *vs.* unemployment

---

# Inflation *vs.* unemployment

In a dynamic economy, increases in .hi[nominal] wages may mask a fall in .hi-orange[real] incomes, when inflation is low and/or stable.

--

However, a .hi[reduction] in nominal wages, on the other hand, will never go unnoticed.

--

<br>

But how does this process *actually* unfold?

<br>

We will study this through a .hi[conflicting claims] approach.

--

First. let us assume an economy with:

  * Several small to medium-sized firms;
  
  * And their employees (ignoring Government, for the time being).
  
---


# Inflation *vs.* unemployment

The firms .hi[set] their market prices based on .hi-orange[costs], plus a .hi[markup] consistent with them making profits.

--

At the same time, firms try to pay *nominal wages* consistent with their targeted profits, but enough to keep workers *motivated.*

  * Moreover, workers .hi-orange[negotiate] each year their target wages.
  
--

<br>

The more .hi-orange[market power] a firm has, the more it can charge for its goods and/or services.

  * Resulting in a .hi[decreasing] real wage!
  
--

And the more organized workers are (via unions and other labor market institutions and policies), the more they can .hi[bargain] for better nominal wages (and consequently, better real wages).

---

# Inflation *vs.* unemployment

So can we say that .hi[higher employment] will lead to .hi-orange[higher inflation]?

--

In 1958, A. W. Phillips (1914&mdash;1975) .hi-orange[empirically] found that low rates of unemployment were associated with high rates of inflation, and high unemployment with low inflation. 

.right[<img style="border-radius: 30%;" src="phillips.png" width="250px"/>]

--

This relationship has since been referred to as the .hi[Phillips curve].

---

# Inflation *vs.* unemployment

[first just the axes]


---

# Inflation *vs.* unemployment

[then the original picture]


---

# Inflation *vs.* unemployment

.hi[How much] additional inflation one gets for a one point acceleration in GDP growth, or a one point fall in unemployment, depends on 

  * The .hi-orange[current values] of the variables;
  
  * On the country's .hi[historical] period;
  
  * And .hi-orange[how long] that period is.
  
<br>


--

Let us now evaluate the .hi[behavior] of the Phillips curve for the US economy over time.




---

# Inflation *vs.* unemployment


[more recent picture for the whole period US]



---

# Inflation *vs.* unemployment

This first "incarnation" of the Phillips Curve assumed a .hi[stable] inflationary scenario.

--

However, that was .hi-orange[not] the case throughout the 1970s.

--

The price level was steadily rising, and, given the .hi[expected] price level, which workers simply take to be last year’s price level, they began to .hi-orange[incorporate] this inflationary context into wage negotiations.

--

In summary, 

  * *Higher* nominal wages lead to a *higher* price level;
  * *Lower* unemployment leads to a *higher* price level this year relative to last year’s price level&mdash;that is, to *higher inflation*. 
  
  * This mechanism is called the .hi[wage–price spiral].
  
---

# Inflation *vs.* unemployment


Therefore, .hi[expectations] enter the picture.

--

When economic agents expect higher prices in teh near future, this expectation takes place in price and wage decisions.

--

Over the 1970s, hiigh inflation in one year became .hi-orange[more likely] to be followed by high inflation the next year.

--

<br>

So a simple .hi-orange[modification] was made to the Phillips Curve setup:

  * Instead of looking at the inflation rate *per se*, economists started to looks at its .hi[change] from year to year.
  



---

# Inflation *vs.* unemployment

[change in inflation over the ywars, reaching NAIRU]


---

# Inflation *vs.* unemployment

<br><br>

From the empirical data, it is possible to see that it is possible to reach a certain .hi[level of unemployment] consistent with an .hi-orange[unchanged] inflation rate over time.

--

<br>

Given that, economists started to accept the notion of a .hi[natural rate of unemployment].

  * This rate is also known as the .hi-orange[Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment] (NAIRU).

---

# Macroeconomic policy

In the 1990s, the policy known as .hi[inflation targeting] by central banks became widely popular in capitalist economies.

--

Governments basically .hi-orange[delegated] to central banks the task of low unemployment consistent with stable inflation.

--

<br>

In a nutshell, inflation targeting implies the central bank changing .hi-orange[interest rates] to influence aggregate demand in order to keep the economy close to an inflation target.

  * Such target is usually specified by the .hi[government].
  
  * In the US economy, [`the long-run target for inflation is 2%`](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/economy_14400.htm).


---

# Macroeconomic policy

When central banks target an inflation rate of, say, 2%, use changes in the policy .hi[interest rate] as their .hi-orange[monetary policy] instrument to stabilize the economy.

--

Monetary policy relies on the central bank being able to .hi[control interest rates], and on changes in interest rates influencing aggregate demand.

--

Recall that the interest rate is the .hi[price of investment], as well as the .hi-orange[price of credit].

--

If the central bank interprets the current state of the economy as "overheated," making it more costly for economic agents to obtain .hi[financing resources] tends to lower the economy's temperature.

  * This way, this policy tends to .hi-orange[decelerate] the wage-price spiral.
