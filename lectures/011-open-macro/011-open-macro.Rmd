# Aggregate expenditures & the foreign sector

# Aggregate expenditures & the foreign sector

To complete our analysis of .hi[output determination], we have *one* (or *two*) pieces left:

--

<br>

.center[
*Output (Y) &equiv; Aggregate Expenditures (AE)*
]

<br>

.center[
*AE = C + I + G + __(X - M)__*
]

--

<br>

where *(X - M)* is the .hi-orange[trade balance] (*aka* .hi[net exports]), the difference between exports (*X*) and imports (*M*).


---

# Aggregate expenditures & the foreign sector

In previous weeks, we saw that an increase in .hi[aggregate planned investment] is capable of increasing output *more than proportionally*.

--

  - Through the .hi[multiplier effect]:
  
.center[
*multiplier = 1/MPS or 1/(1 - MPC)*
]

--

<br>

Also, in the *absence* of new private investment, the .hi-orange[government] can generate these multiplier effects in .hi[3] ways:

  - Government spending multiplier: *1/MPS or 1/(1 - MPC)*;
  
  - Tax multiplier: *-(MPC/MPS)*;
  
  - Balanced-budget multiplier: *1*
  
---

# Aggregate expenditures & the foreign sector

When the .hi-orange[foreign sector] is included, we bring:

  - The goods and services it .hi[exports] to the rest of the world;
  
  - The goods and services it .hi[imports] from the rest of the world.


--

<br>

Then, for the time being, we assume:

  - *Exports (X)* are .hi[not] affected by the state of the local economy;
  
  - When the local country's economy improves, its *Imports (M)* rise:
  
.center[
*M = mY*
]

--

where *m (m > 0)* is the country's .hi[marginal propensity to import] (*MPM*).

---

# Aggregate expenditures & the foreign sector

Now that our economy does business with the *rest of the world*, we may .hi[improve] the example from previous weeks:

  - Aggregate consumption: *C = 150 + 0.8Y<sub>d</sub>*;
  - Aggregate planned investment: *I = $150*;
  - Government expenditures: *G = $100*;
  - Taxes on consumption: *T = $100*;
  - Exports: *X = $500*;
  - Imports: *M = 0.3Y*


--

<br>

*(a)* What is the .hi[equilibrium] level of output in this economy?

*(b)* Suppose the government wants to *boost* GDP by $260. By how much should it increase its expenditures, without changing taxes?


---

# Aggregate expenditures & the foreign sector

The .hi[open-economy multiplier] is given by

<br>

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Open-economy multiplier} = \dfrac{1}{1 - \text{MPC} - \text{MPM}}
\end{aligned}
$$

--

<br>

where *(MPC - MPM)* is the *marginal propensity to consume* .hi[domestic goods and services].

--

<br><br><br>

Is the open-economy multiplier *smaller* or *larger* than the (closed-economy) multiplier?



---

# Aggregate expenditures & the foreign sector


In J.M. Keynes's (1936, ch. 10) words:

> *"In an open system with foreign-trade relations, some part of the multiplier of the
increased investment will accrue to the benefit of employment in foreign countries, since
a proportion of the increased consumption will diminish our own country's favourable
foreign balance; so that, if we consider only the effect on domestic employment as
distinct from world employment, we must diminish the full figure of the multiplier. On
the other hand our own country may recover a portion of this leakage through favourable
repercussions due to the action of the multiplier in the foreign country in increasing its
economic activity."*

--

<br>

Therefore, when .hi[government spending] (or .hi[investment]) increases and income and consumption rise, some of the extra consumption spending that results is on *foreign products* and not on *domestically produced* goods and services.

# *Savings = Investment* re-revisited


---

# *Savings = Investment* re-revisited

In a .hi-orange[*closed*] economy context, we had

.center[
*S + T = I + G*
]

--

Meaning that any new .hi[injection] (*G* or *I*) must come out of .hi-orange[leakages], i.e., resources that have not been consumed (*S* or *T*).

--

<br><br>

In an .hi[*open*] economy, *Imports (M)* are another source of .hi-orange[leakages] of domestic income.

--

And *Exports (X)*, on the other hand, are new .hi[injections].

---

# *Savings = Investment* re-revisited

We can thus .hi[rewrite] the previous condition as 

.center[
*S + T + M = G + I + X*
]

--



Rearranging,


.center[
*(S - I) = (X - M) + (G - T)*
]

<br>

--

- If *(X - M) < 0*, the country has a .hi[trade deficit].

--

- If *(G - T) > 0*, the country has a .hi[budget deficit].

--

When both happen simultaneously, the country experiences .hi-orange[twin deficits].<sup>1</sup>.footnote[<sup>1</sup>The term *"twin deficits"* was coined by [Martin Feldstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Feldstein) (1939&mdash;2019).]

---

# *Savings = Investment* re-revisited


<br><br><br>


[`Twin deficits in the United States?`](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A019RE1Q156NBEA#0)

---


# *Savings = Investment* re-revisited


Another way of looking at the previous relationship is:

.center[
*(S - I) = (X - M) + (G - T)*
]

.center[
*I = S + (M - X) + (T - G)*
]


--

<br>

where *S* are .hi[private] savings; *(M - X)* are .hi[foreign] savings; and *(T - G)* are .hi[public] savings.

--



This implies that any private investment has .hi-orange[three] sources of *financing* in an open economy:

  - *Private* debt;
  
  - *Budget* deficits;
  
  - *Trade balance* deficits.


---

# *Savings = Investment* re-revisited

From our example, .hi[after] the increase in government spending, does the 

<br>

.center[
*(S - I) = (X - M) + (G - T)*
]


relationship .hi-orange[hold]?

<br>

Also, how was private investment .hi[financed]?

# Trade barriers


Albeit expanding the possibilities for growth and trade, doing business with the rest of the world may face some .hi[barriers].

--

Some of the most common are:

  - Trade .hi-orange[tariffs];
  
  - Export .hi[subsidies];
  
  - .hi-orange[Dumping];
  
  - Import .hi[quotas].
  
  
---

# Trade barriers

Trade .hi[tariffs] are *taxes* on imports.

--

These can be used either as a source of government *revenue*, or as a *protection* device for local industries.


--

---

# Trade barriers

Export .hi[subsidies] are government *payments* made to domestic businesses to encourage exports.


--

<br>


.hi-orange[Dumping] occurs when a firm or industry sells products abroad at prices *lower* than its production costs.

  - It is seen as "unfair competition."

---

# Trade barriers

<br><br>

Lastly, import .hi[quotas] are *limits* imposed (either voluntarily or through legislation) on the quantity of imports made by a country.
